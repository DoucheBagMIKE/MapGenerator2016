# TO DO

- More and better examples
- A decent stress test
- Maybe a TeaTime manager will be a better choice
- Improve time precision ^
- Use arrays instead of generic lists ^

## DONE

- x Yoyo mode (Forward, Backward cycle)
- x A good testing to Reverse/Backward/Forward mode
- x Rewrite the main algorithm to optimize coroutine instantiation
- x Replace Foreachs by For
- x TeaTime should be able to wait other TeaTimes
- x Lots of things before starting this to-do
